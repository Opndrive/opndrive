Duplicate check for each file → Show duplicate dialog if conflicts found →
User chooses action → Files added to upload queue
```

### 2. Folder Selection & Duplicate Detection

```
User clicks "Folder upload" → Folder picker opens → Folder selected →
Extract all files from folder → Check if folder already exists →
Show duplicate dialog if conflict → User chooses action →
All files added to upload queue with proper folder structure
```

### 3. Queue Processing with Smart Status

```
Files added to queue → Sequential processing → S3 upload with multipart →
Real-time progress tracking → Success/Error handling →
Smart status display (completed/failed/cancelled)
```

### 4. S3 Integration with Error Handling

```
File → Generate S3 key → Check for duplicates → Multipart upload →
Progress callbacks → Handle errors gracefully → Update UI status
```

## Smart Duplicate Detection System

### How Duplicate Detection Works

#### **File Duplicate Detection**

1. **Check Process**: Before uploading, system calls `fetchMetadata(s3Key)` for
   each file
2. **Detection Logic**: If metadata exists, file already exists in that location
3. **User Dialog**: Custom dialog appears with file details and three options
4. **Smart Handling**: Different actions based on user choice

#### **Folder Duplicate Detection**

1. **Check Process**: Before uploading, system calls `fetchDirectoryStructure()`
   to check folder prefix
2. **Detection Logic**: If any files exist with the folder prefix, folder
   structure exists
3. **User Dialog**: Custom dialog appears with folder details and three options
4. **Smart Handling**: Applies choice to entire folder structure

### Duplicate Dialog Options

#### **🔄 Replace**

- Overwrites existing file/folder completely
- Updates status to "uploading" and proceeds with upload
- Shows "Replaced [filename]" in final status

#### **⏭️ Skip**

- Cancels upload for that specific item
- Marks status as "cancelled" with message "File already exists"
- Other items in queue continue uploading normally

#### **📁 Keep Both**

- Generates unique name automatically (e.g., `document (1).pdf`, `MyFolder (2)`)
- Updates item name in upload queue to show new name
- Proceeds with upload using the unique name
- Shows new name in progress and final status

### Unique Name Generation

#### **File Names**

```typescript
// Original: document.pdf → document (1).pdf
// If (1) exists: document.pdf → document (2).pdf
// Continues up to: document (1000).pdf
```

#### **Folder Names**

```typescript
// Original: MyFolder → MyFolder (1)
// If (1) exists: MyFolder → MyFolder (2)
// Continues up to: MyFolder (1000)
```

### Technical Implementation

#### **API Methods Used**

- **Files**: `apiS3.fetchMetadata(s3Key)` - Fast metadata check
- **Folders**: `apiS3.fetchDirectoryStructure(prefix)` - Directory listing check
- **Upload**: `apiS3.uploadMultipart()` - Reliable multipart upload

#### **Error Handling**

- **Network Errors**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **404 Errors**: Treated as "file doesn't exist" (not an error)
- **Permission Errors**: Clear error messages to user
- **Invalid Names**: Automatic sanitization and validation

## Upload Card UI Features

### Smart Auto-Hide Functionality

- **Intelligent Visibility**: Card automatically appears when uploads start
- **Auto-Hide Logic**: Disappears when upload queue is completely empty
- **Conditional Rendering**: Uses
  `if (!isOpen || items.length === 0) return null;`
- **Clean Interface**: No empty upload cards cluttering the dashboard

### Force Close & Queue Management

- **Cross Icon**: Red X button for immediate card closure
- **Force Close**: Closes card even during active uploads (with user
  confirmation)
- **Smart Clearing**: Automatically removes completed/cancelled items
- **Queue Control**: Users can close card and uploads continue in background

### Enhanced Status Display

- **Real-time Status**: Distinguishes between uploading, completed, cancelled,
  and failed
- **Smart Messaging**:
  - `"Uploading 3 of 5 files..."` (during active uploads)
  - `"5 files uploaded successfully"` (all completed)
  - `"2 files cancelled, 3 uploaded"` (mixed results with duplicates)
  - `"1 failed, 4 completed"` (with errors)
- **Progress Indicators**: Shows individual file progress and overall queue
  progress
- **Error Details**: Specific error messages for different failure types
- **Color Coding**: Green for success, red for errors, orange for cancelled

### Custom Duplicate Dialog Features

- **Google Drive Style**: Professional modal design matching Google Drive
- **File Information**: Shows file name, size, type, and modification date
- **Preview Support**: File icons and folder icons for better visual
  identification

## S3 Integration Details

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# AWS Configuration (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION="your-aws-region"           # e.g., "us-east-1"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME="your-s3-bucket-name"     # e.g., "my-storage-bucket"
```

### S3 API Methods Used

#### **Primary Upload Method: `uploadMultipart()`**

- **Purpose**: Reliable upload for files of any size with progress tracking
- **Parameters**:
  ```typescript
  {
    file: File,           // The file object to upload
    key: string,         // S3 key (path) where file will be stored
    onProgress?: (progress: number) => void  // Progress callback (0-100)
  }
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Works for any file size (from bytes to gigabytes)
  - Provides real-time progress tracking
  - Handles network interruptions with retry logic
  - Automatically chunks large files

#### **Alternative Method: `uploadMultipartParallely()`**

- **Purpose**: Faster upload for large files using concurrent chunks
- **Parameters**:
  ```typescript
  {
    file: File,
    key: string,
    partSizeMB: 5,              // Size of each chunk (5MB default)
    concurrency: 3,             // Number of parallel uploads
    onProgress?: (progress: number) => void
  }
  ```
- **Use Case**: Large files (>50MB) with good internet connection

#### **Duplicate Detection Methods**

##### **For Files: `fetchMetadata()`**

```typescript
// Check if file exists
try {
  const metadata = await apiS3.fetchMetadata(s3Key);
  // File exists if metadata is returned
  console.log('File exists:', metadata.size, 'bytes');
} catch (error) {
  // File doesn't exist (404 error)
  console.log('File is new, can upload');
}
```

##### **For Folders: `fetchDirectoryStructure()`**

```typescript
// Check if folder exists
try {
  const structure = await apiS3.fetchDirectoryStructure(folderPrefix);
  if (structure.length > 0) {
    console.log('Folder exists with', structure.length, 'items');
  } else {
    console.log("Folder is empty or doesn't exist");
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Folder doesn't exist, can create");
}
```

### S3 Key Generation

#### **Function: `generateS3Key(fileName, currentPath)`**

Creates proper S3 keys (file paths) for upload:

```typescript
// Examples:
generateS3Key("document.pdf", "/")          → "document.pdf"
generateS3Key("image.jpg", "/photos/")      → "photos/image.jpg"
generateS3Key("file.txt", "/docs/work/")    → "docs/work/file.txt"
```

#### **Folder Upload Key Generation**

For folder uploads, preserves complete directory structure:

```typescript
// Input:
//   relativePath = "MyFolder/subfolder/file.txt"
//   currentPath = "/documents/"
// Output: "documents/MyFolder/subfolder/file.txt"

// Input:
//   relativePath = "Photos/vacation/beach.jpg"
//   currentPath = "/"
// Output: "Photos/vacation/beach.jpg"
```

#### **S3 Key Rules**

- ❌ **No leading slashes** (S3 requirement - keys can't start with "/")
- ✅ **Proper path concatenation** with automatic slash handling
- ✅ **Root folder handling** ("/" becomes empty prefix)
- ✅ **Nested structure preservation** using `webkitRelativePath`
- ✅ **Special character handling** (automatic URL encoding when needed)

## Upload Methods & Performance

### Auto Method (Default & Recommended)

- **Smart Selection**: Automatically chooses best upload method based on file
  size
- **Small Files (<50MB)**: Direct multipart upload for speed
- **Large Files (>50MB)**: Multipart with enhanced progress tracking
- **Optimal Performance**: Balances speed and reliability automatically

### Multipart Method

- **AWS Standard**: Uses official AWS S3 multipart upload API
- **Chunk Size**: 5MB chunks by default (configurable)
- **Sequential Upload**: Uploads chunks one by one for stability
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates per chunk
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry for failed chunks

### Multipart-Concurrent Method

- **High Performance**: Parallel chunk uploads for maximum speed
- **Configurable**: Adjustable concurrency (default: 3 parallel uploads)
- **Best For**: Large files (>100MB) with good internet connection
- **Resource Usage**: Higher memory and bandwidth usage
- **Reliability**: Built-in retry logic for each concurrent chunk

### Performance Optimization

#### **File Size Recommendations**

- **< 5MB**: Direct upload (fastest)
- **5MB - 50MB**: Standard multipart (balanced)
- **50MB - 500MB**: Multipart with higher chunk size
- **> 500MB**: Multipart-concurrent (fastest for large files)

#### **Network Optimization**

- **Good Connection**: Use multipart-concurrent for large files
- **Poor Connection**: Use standard multipart for reliability
- **Mobile**: Use auto method for adaptive performance

## File Types & Restrictions

### Supported File Types

- **All File Types**: No restrictions on file extensions (`accept="*/*"`)
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, etc.
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP, TIFF, etc.
- **Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, etc.
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, etc.
- **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, 7Z, TAR, etc.
- **Code**: JS, TS, PY, HTML, CSS, etc.

### File Size Limits

- **No Hard Limits**: Multipart upload handles files of any size
- **Practical Limits**: Limited by browser memory and S3 service limits
- **Tested Sizes**: Successfully tested up to 5GB files
- **Memory Efficient**: Sequential processing prevents browser crashes

### File Name Handling

- **Special Characters**: Automatically sanitized for S3 compatibility
- **Unicode Support**: Proper encoding for international characters
- **Length Limits**: Maximum 1024 characters (S3 limit)
- **Duplicate Names**: Automatic numbering system for conflicts

## Folder Upload Implementation

### How Folder Upload Works

1. **Folder Selection**: Uses HTML5 `webkitdirectory` attribute for native
   folder picker
2. **File Extraction**: Extracts all files from selected folder including nested
   subdirectories
3. **Structure Analysis**: Reads `webkitRelativePath` to maintain exact folder
   hierarchy
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Checks if folder already exists using S3 directory
   structure API
5. **Sequential Upload**: Uploads files one by one to avoid overwhelming S3 and
   browser memory
6. **Progress Tracking**: Shows both overall progress and individual file
   progress

### Key Features

#### **Complete Structure Preservation**

- **Nested Folders**: Supports unlimited folder depth (e.g.,
  `folder/sub1/sub2/sub3/file.txt`)
- **Empty Folders**: Handles folders with no files (creates folder structure)
- **Mixed Content**: Supports folders with files and subfolders mixed together
- **Original Names**: Preserves exact file and folder names including special
  characters

#### **Smart Progress Display**

- **File Count**: Shows "X of Y files uploaded" for folder progress
- **Overall Progress**: Combined progress bar for entire folder upload
- **Individual Files**: Each file shows its own upload progress
- **Status Updates**: Real-time status for each file (pending → uploading →
  completed)

#### **Error Recovery & Resilience**

- **Individual Failures**: Failed files don't stop the entire folder upload
- **Memory Efficient**: Sequential processing prevents browser memory issues
- **Network Recovery**: Automatic retry logic for network interruptions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with remaining files if some fail

### Technical Implementation Details

#### **Folder Upload Data Structure**

```typescript
{
  id: string,                  // Unique identifier for the folder upload
  name: "MyFolder",           // Display name of the folder
  type: "folder",             // Type identifier
  size: 15728640,             // Total size of all files in bytes
  files: File[],              // Array of all files in the folder
  uploadedFiles: 5,           // Number of files completed
  totalFiles: 10,             // Total number of files to upload
  progress: 50,               // Overall progress percentage (0-100)
  status: "uploading",        // Current status (pending/uploading/completed/error)
  relativePaths: string[]     // Array of relative paths for structure preservation
}
```

#### **File Processing Logic**

```typescript
// Example folder structure:
MyFolder/
  ├── document.pdf
  ├── images/
  │   ├── photo1.jpg
  │   └── photo2.png
  └── docs/
      └── readme.txt

// Resulting S3 keys (if uploaded to /projects/):
projects/MyFolder/document.pdf
projects/MyFolder/images/photo1.jpg
projects/MyFolder/images/photo2.png
projects/MyFolder/docs/readme.txt
```

## Usage Examples & Integration

### Basic File Upload

```typescript
import { useUploadHandler } from '@/features/upload/hooks/use-upload-handler';

function MyComponent() {
  const { handleFileUpload } = useUploadHandler({
    currentPath: '/documents/',
    uploadMethod: 'auto',
  });

  const onFileSelect = async (files: FileList) => {
    await handleFileUpload(files);
  };

  return (
    <input
      type="file"
      multiple
      onChange={(e) => e.target.files && onFileSelect(e.target.files)}
    />
  );
}
```

### Folder Upload with Custom Settings

```typescript
import { useUploadHandler } from '@/features/upload/hooks/use-upload-handler';

function FolderUploader() {
  const { handleFolderUpload } = useUploadHandler({
    currentPath: '/projects/',
    uploadMethod: 'multipart-concurrent', // For large folders
  });

  return (
    <input
      type="file"
      webkitdirectory
      onChange={(e) => e.target.files && handleFolderUpload(e.target.files)}
    />
  );
}
```

### Upload Progress Monitoring

```typescript
import { useUploadStore } from '@/features/upload/stores/use-upload-store';

function UploadMonitor() {
  const { items, isOpen } = useUploadStore();

  const activeUploads = items.filter(item => item.status === 'uploading');
  const completedUploads = items.filter(item => item.status === 'completed');

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Active: {activeUploads.length}</p>
      <p>Completed: {completedUploads.length}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Optimization

# Delete Operations with Progress Tracking - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a scalable delete operations system that integrates
with the existing upload card/item infrastructure to show delete progress with a
unified, generic operations architecture.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Operations Manager (`operations-manager.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Generic system for tracking any type of operation
  (upload/delete/move/copy)
- **Features**:
  - Progress tracking with AbortController support
  - Integration with existing upload store
  - Scalable architecture for future operation types
  - Automatic cleanup of completed operations

### 2. Delete Operations Hook (`use-delete-operations.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Progress-enabled file and folder deletion
- **Features**:
  - Individual file deletion with progress tracking
  - Folder deletion with recursive content processing
  - Integration with operations manager for cancellation support
  - Real-time progress updates shown in upload card

### 3. Enhanced Delete Hook (`use-delete-with-progress.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Bridge between dashboard components and progress-enabled deletes
- **Features**:
  - Drop-in replacement for existing `useDelete` hook
  - Automatically opens upload card to show progress
  - Maintains same API as original delete hook

### 4. Updated UI Components

#### Upload Card (`upload-card.tsx`)

- Enhanced header logic to handle mixed operations (uploads, deletes, etc.)
- Smart status reporting: "5 uploading, 2 deleting" or "3 uploaded, 1 deleted"
- Proper icon selection for different operation types

#### Upload Item (`upload-item.tsx`)

- Delete-specific status icons (Minus icon for pending deletes, red spinner for
  active deletes)
- Delete-specific status text ("Deleting...", "Deleted", "Delete failed", etc.)
- Contextual action buttons (no pause for deletes, proper cancel labels)

#### Overflow Menus

- **File Menu**: Updated to use `useDeleteWithProgress` for seamless integration
- **Folder Menu**: Updated to use `useDeleteWithProgress` for seamless
  integration

## Technical Architecture

### Progress Flow

1. User clicks "Delete" in overflow menu
2. `useDeleteWithProgress` opens upload card and calls `deleteFileWithProgress`
3. `operationsManager.startOperation()` creates operation item in upload store
4. Delete operation runs with real-time progress updates
5. Upload card shows delete progress alongside any ongoing uploads
6. On completion, item shows "Deleted" status and can be removed

### S3 API Integration

- Fixed S3 API method calls (uses `deleteFile` not `deleteObject`)
- Handles both single file and recursive folder deletion
- No batch delete API available, so implemented sequential deletion with
  progress

### Cancellation Support

- Delete operations support cancellation through AbortController
- Integration with upload store's existing cancel infrastructure
- Proper cleanup on cancel (operation marked as cancelled, resources freed)

## User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback

- **Immediate**: Upload card opens showing delete operation in progress
- **Progress**: Real-time progress bar and percentage for large folder deletes
- **Status**: Clear status messages ("Deleting...", "Deleted", "Delete
  cancelled")
- **Icons**: Contextually appropriate icons (red spinner for deleting, checkmark
  for completed)

### Mixed Operations

- Upload card can simultaneously show uploads and deletes
- Smart header: "3 uploading, 1 deleting" when mixed operations are active
- Each operation type has appropriate controls (uploads can be paused, deletes
  cannot)

### Scalability

- Generic operations manager supports future operation types (move, copy, etc.)
- Same UI infrastructure works for any operation type
- Easy to add new operation types without changing core upload card logic

## Error Handling

### S3 API Errors

- Fixed TypeScript errors by using correct API method names
- Proper error propagation and display in upload card
- Failed operations show clear error messages

### Network Issues

- AbortController enables clean cancellation
- Proper cleanup on network errors or user cancellation
- Error state clearly displayed in upload card

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `frontend/src/features/upload/services/operations-manager.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/upload/hooks/use-delete-operations.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/dashboard/hooks/use-delete-with-progress.ts`

### Modified Files

- `frontend/src/features/upload/components/upload-card.tsx` - Enhanced header
  logic
- `frontend/src/features/upload/components/upload-item.tsx` - Delete-specific UI
- `frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/ui/menus/file-overflow-menu.tsx` -
  Progress integration
- `frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/ui/menus/folder-overflow-menu.tsx` -
  Progress integration

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Single File Delete**: Test progress tracking for individual files
2. **Folder Delete**: Test recursive deletion with progress for folders
   containing many files
3. **Mixed Operations**: Test simultaneous uploads and deletes
4. **Cancellation**: Test cancel functionality during delete operations
5. **Error Handling**: Test behavior with network errors or API failures
6. **UI States**: Verify all status states display correctly in upload card

## Future Enhancements

The implemented architecture supports easy addition of:

- **Move Operations**: File/folder moves with progress tracking
- **Copy Operations**: File/folder copies with progress tracking
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple files/folders processed simultaneously
- **Advanced Progress**: ETA calculations, speed indicators, etc.

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented a scalable, user-friendly delete operations system that
integrates seamlessly with the existing upload infrastructure. The system
provides clear visual feedback, supports cancellation, handles errors
gracefully, and is architected to support future operation types.
